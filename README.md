# PHHCRSP

Source code

This is the windows version of the program. Has been compiled with visual studio 2017. Source files are in standard c++
Running the solver

ILP_PHHCRSP	Instances <input_file> <solution_file> <timeout> <random_seed>

For example, the command line:

ILP_PHHCRSP	Instances 0407-8-50-5-1.txt -m 3 -t 600 -o 4 -c 8 -t 60 

Command Syntax
ILP_PHHCRSP <input_file> -m <mode> -t <time_limit> -o <output_option> -c <constraint_option> -t <secondary_time_limit>
Parameters
<input_file>: Specifies the path to the input file containing the instances to be processed. Example: 0407-8-50-5-1.txt.
-m <mode>: Sets the mode of operation. The mode 3 is used in the example command.
-t <time_limit>: Defines the primary time limit (in seconds) for the operation. Note that -t appears twice in the command, which seems to be a mistake. The first occurrence sets a time limit of 600 seconds.
-o <output_option>: Selects the output option. In the example, 4 specifies the type of output generated by the tool.
-c <constraint_option>: Determines the constraint option to be applied during processing. The example uses 8 as the constraint setting.
-t <secondary_time_limit>: Appears to be incorrectly repeated. Ideally, each option should be distinct. Assuming the second -t aims to set a different parameter (like a secondary time limit), it's set to 60 seconds in the example.

Notes
Ensure the command includes unique flags for each parameter to avoid confusion, as seen with the -t flag repeated in the example.
